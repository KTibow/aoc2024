# aoc2024

hi. these are my advent of code solutions for 2024.

it's not really great in any single way:
- mostly clean code, but some parts are messy
- mostly made without ai, but copilot was used
- mostly fast, but some parts are slow
- mostly completed, but some days (day 17 pt 2, day 19 pt 2, day 21, day 25 pt 2) are missing
- got onto the public leaderboard twice, but that's a minority

it was fun. not sure if i'll do it the same way next year.
